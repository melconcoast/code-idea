# Changelog

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-11
### Added
- Initial release of `code-idea`.
- Dynamic interview workflow: gathers a plan, asks only what isn't already known, proposes grounded recommendations (tech stack, database/caching, UI theme/typography) rather than open questions.
- Per-project structure decisions — no fixed template; generates `AGENTS.md`, and only the linked docs (`architecture.md`, `decisions.md`, `roadmap.md`, `product.md`, `design-system.md`) and nested per-subsystem files a given project actually warrants.
- Defaults to nested `AGENTS.md` for monorepo/subdirectory context (cross-tool, closest-file-wins, supported by 20+ agents) rather than nested `CLAUDE.md`, which only nested-Claude-Code teams should use instead.
- `references/best-practices.md` — research backing for file-size limits, rule ordering, and the decisions-vs-product split.
- `references/recommendation-heuristics.md` — grounded defaults for stack, database, caching, and UI design choices.
- `references/templates.md` — skeleton structure for each generated doc type.
